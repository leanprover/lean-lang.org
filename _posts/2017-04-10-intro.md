At the start of the year we released Lean 3.0.0, a new major version of the tool known internally as "Lean 3".
The Lean team has been working hard on this release for over one year. This release brought many signifigant changes,
and the team is in the process of bringing the official documentation up to date, as well as working on providing more
'soft' documentation in a series of blogs, and guides.

In the intervening six months we have been hard at work, culminating in the recently released Lean 3.2.0.
This new release has many new features, and bug fixes with some of the highlights being:

- `leanpkg` a package manager for Lean developments and their dependencies
- `mutual` definition and datatype support
- `coinductive` predicates
- type class input/output parameters
- the ability to run `io` actions in the tactic framework

For a full description of the changes check out the change log which can be found
[here](https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/doc/changes.md).

# Communication Mediums

We have been trying to clarify where communication happens in the project, and recommend that
users use [https://gitter.im/leanprover_public/Lobby] for questions and one off discussion, the mailing
list continues to be active for longer form issues, and bug reports should be filed on the Lean GitHub
repository.

# Roadmap

We have clearly categorized our priorities using GitHub issues so users can track when and what we are working on.
The Roadmap can be found [here](https://github.com/leanprover/lean) and is seperated into open RFCs, features
which are in-progress, a wish list, and open high priority issues.

# Looking Forward

In many ways Lean 3 is just the start for Lean, we have many more exciting features in the pipeline and hope to
share many of them with you this year. We also have plans for new teaching materials, a reference manual, and
much more.

# Getting Involved

As always contributions are welcome and we encourage you to check out our getting started guides, come talk to
us in Gitter, or check out the issue tracker, issues marked `E-help-wanted` are a great place to start.
