Lean is a new open source
theorem prover being developed at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com">Microsoft Research</a>, and its
standard library at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.
Lean aims to bridge the gap between interactive
and automated theorem proving, by situating automated tools and
methods in a framework that supports user interaction and the
construction of fully specified axiomatic proofs. The goal is to
support both mathematical reasoning and reasoning about complex
systems, and to verify claims in both domains.

The Lean project was launched by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft
Research in 2013. It is a collaborative open source project, hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/leanprover/lean). Contributions to the
code base and library are welcome.

You can experiment with an
[online version of Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/tutorial/?live)
that runs in your browser, or try the online tutorials listed under [Documentation](../documentation).
