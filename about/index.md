Lean is an open source theorem prover and programming language being developed at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com">Microsoft Research</a>.
Lean aims to bridge the gap between interactive
and automated theorem proving, by situating automated tools and
methods in a framework that supports user interaction and the
construction of fully specified axiomatic proofs.

The Lean project was launched by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft
Research in 2013. It is an open source project, hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/leanprover). [Lean 3](https://github.com/leanprover/lean)
is the latest official release. Development has shifted to [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4),
which is not ready for general use yet. Meanwhile, members of the Lean community centered
around the mathematical components library [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib)
have continued maintenance and development of Lean 3 as a separate [community version](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean).
Further information about mathlib and the Lean 3 community releases can be found at the [Lean Community](https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html)
website, including an online version of Lean.
