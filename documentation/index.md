- [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/) is a tutorial with exercises.
You almost certainly want to read it at some point anyway, since it explains foundational things much better
than any hands-on tutorial could do.

- The [Lean 4 manual](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/) (work in progress) will give you an overview of the language.

- [Functional Programming in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/functional_programming_in_lean/).

- [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/index.html).

- [The Mechanics of Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/). This is a set of lecture notes dealing with how to write careful, rigorous mathematical proofs.
These lecture notes are aimed at the early university level and have been written for the course Math 2001, at Fordham University.

Lean 4 first milestone release is available. You are welcome to experiment with it, but please
recognize that the system is still changing, and if you are looking
for stability, it may not be the system for you. Similarly, the project
cannot accommodate feature requests at this stage. If you are trying to decide
whether to invest time in learning to use Lean right now, this

You can also experiment with Lean 4 in an [online](https://lean.math.hhu.de/)
code playground in your browser.
The [learning resources page](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html)
of the community website lists many tutorials and documentation sources for Lean 4.

## Chat Room

A public chat room dedicated to Lean is open on [Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/).
